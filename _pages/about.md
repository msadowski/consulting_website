Hi, I'm Mat Sadowski. A passionate robotics consultant with nine years of experience, more than half of it as an independent consultant.

I treat every project as I would treat my own, offering expertise to solve customer problems timely and with the least amount of risk. You are always in the loop on progress, time estimates, and high-risk tasks when working with me.

Every week, I spend around six hours working on my [robotics newsletter](https://www.weeklyrobotics.com/), constantly learning about news, projects and trends in Robotics.

***

> Mat is a phenomenal consultant, and we love working with him. Extremely knowledgeable and levels up everyone he works with. Continues to add value even after the engagement, and his passion is infectious!

-- Charles Brian Quinn, CEO of [Greenzie](https://www.greenzie.com/)
